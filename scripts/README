In this folder, put all interactive scripts. 

Ideally, scripts should use reproducible code in the form 
of functions, implemented in the package in src/python-base/, 
and use configuration from the config.yaml.

This folder can be further breaked down into (n.b. this is just a suggestion).
scripts/data_collection/
scripts/data_cleaning/
scripts/feature_preparation/
scripts/training/
scripts/evaluation/
